[03/11 23:57:40     60] 	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including tQuantus, IQRC and Quantus QRC extraction.
[03/11 23:57:40     60] 	Capacitance filtering mode(-capFilterMode option of the setExtractRCMode) is 'relAndCoup' for all engines.
[03/11 23:57:40     60] 	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'high'.
[03/11 23:57:40     60] 	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode will be 'medium' if Quantus QRC technology file is specified else 'low'.
[03/11 23:57:40     60] Updating process node dependent CCOpt properties for the 65nm process node.
